# README

Black Shop of Horrors is a online shop where you can purchase black market items that would otherwise be illegal.

We developed it via TDD, per stories from our "client", over the course of a week and a half.

This was a group project by [Seth Mo](https://github.com/themenintights), [Christopher Dale](https://github.com/Cdale3), and [Josh Thompson](https://github.com/josh-works).
